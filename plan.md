# Pathfinder: IMDF Routing Library

## Overview
Pathfinder is a TypeScript library designed to enable routing between features in IMDF (Indoor Mapping Data Format) using GeoJSON FeatureCollections. It provides flexible pathfinding capabilities with custom cost functions, allowing for advanced routing scenarios such as avoiding staff-only areas.

## Key Features
1. IMDF GeoJSON parsing and processing
2. Multi-level pathfinding using `properties.levelId`
3. Customizable cost functions
4. TypeScript implementation
5. Vite-based build system

## Library Structure
1. Core Components
   - GeoJSON parser
   - Graph builder
   - Pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A* or Dijkstra's)
   - Cost function interface

2. Utility Functions
   - Distance calculations
   - Coordinate transformations
   - Level transitions

3. API
   - Initialization with GeoJSON FeatureCollection
   - Pathfinding function
   - Cost function registration

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up project with TypeScript and Vite
2. Implement GeoJSON parsing and validation
3. Develop graph building algorithm from GeoJSON features
4. Implement core pathfinding algorithm
5. Create cost function interface and default implementations
6. Develop multi-level routing capabilities
7. Implement API for library usage
8. Add utility functions for distance calculations and coordinate transformations
9. Create documentation and usage examples
10. Implement test suite
11. Optimize performance
12. Package library for distribution

## Advanced Features (Future Enhancements)
1. Real-time updates to the routing graph
2. Support for temporal restrictions (e.g., time-based access control)
3. Integration with external data sources for dynamic cost calculations
4. Visualization tools for debugging and demonstration

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for individual components
2. Integration tests for the complete pathfinding process
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Edge case testing (e.g., disconnected graphs, invalid inputs)

## Documentation
1. API reference
2. Usage examples
3. Custom cost function guide
4. Performance optimization tips

By following this plan, we will create a robust, flexible, and efficient IMDF routing library that can be easily integrated into various applications requiring indoor navigation capabilities.
